         <p>   This is a guest post by Pete Wilson, general manager for Asia-Pacific at Apptio, based in Sydney. We’ve started a new financial year with uncertainty among the only certainties in business. Although this might seem like cause for despair, there is opportunity amid ongoing economic headwinds and rising costs. While Australian companies and their management teams can’t control the market, there are ample ways to plan for the future to both tackle financial headaches and mitigate the impacts of inflation. The first instinct for many executives, CIOs and CFOs will be to tighten purse strings; they’ll cut back on technology spend and sweat existing assets – some past their ‘used by’ date – as a way to conserve funds for the rainy days ahead. But making substantial cuts to technology budgets is short-sighted, and hampers years of progress to transform business for the digital economy in which it operates. Gartner’s Stewart Buchanan notes: “In response to the current economic turmoil, organisations are using digital technology to realise operational efficiency and cost savings and to transform their company’s value proposition, revenue and client interactions. This means a steady IT budget is necessary to push these digital business initiatives forward”. </p>
